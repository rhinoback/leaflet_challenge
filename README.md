Making the best most interesting maps we can!
In this very cool challenge, the objective was to design maps with layers, as well as use API calls to the USGS. This challenge required HTML, CSS, Javascript, APIs, Mapbox, Leaflet.js, and some other skills to create some very fun and awesome to work with maps!
how did we explore?
how did we find new worlds?
how did we become we? 
through history, good and bad, the maps are the story.  in the present we look at a map and some of us can't help but dream.  anyone one who believes that an evolution of mapping isn't an evolution into the future doesn't fully understand the human story. 
I wan't to get better at understanding this.
